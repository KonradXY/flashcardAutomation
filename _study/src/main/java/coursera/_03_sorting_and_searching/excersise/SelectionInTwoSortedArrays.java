    /*
    Given two sorted arrays a[] and b[] of lengths n1 and n2 and an integer
    0 <= k <= n1+n2 design an algorithm to find a key of rank k. The order of
    growth of the worst case running time of your algorithm should be logn
   - version 1 : n1 = n2 and k = n/2 (median)
   - version 2 : k = n/2
   - version 3 : no restruction

   // TODO - to find a key means to find how many elements are less than k in the array

   // TODO - Devo studiare la binary search

   TODO - there are two basic approaches:
   1. Compute the median in a[] and in b[]. Recur in a subproblem of roughly half the size
   2. Design a constant-time algorithm to determine whether a[i] is a key of rank k. Use this
   subroutine and binary search.
