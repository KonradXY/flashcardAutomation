What is the effective meaning of the spanish "en" ? |
It is important to understand the Spanish preposition en, which expresses the English meanings “in,” “on,” “into,” and “at.” Prepositions in Spanish can have very literal meanings. For example, to express in English that you have a job with the Sears department store, you would probably say, “I work at Sears.” The reality, however, is that when you are working, you are physically in the Sears store, and so to express the same idea in Spanish, you would say, Trabajo en Sears. See the sentences below for more examples of how Spanish en can be expressed in English.
Examples:
- estoy en su casa - I am in his house
- el cuadro esta' en la pared - the painting is on the wall
- echa jugo en los vasos - she pours juice into the glasses
- estoy en la puerta de su casa - I am at the door of his house
- miro los retratos en el museo - I look at the portaits at the museum
- compro mi roma en bloomingdale's - I buy my clothing at bloomingdale's

What are the preposition of movement ? |
In addition to telling which one? and where?, prepositions can indicate movement—where someone or something is going. In the sentences that follow, the same prepositional phrase (a lo largo de, meaning “along”) has an adjectival function in the first sentence and an adverbial function in the second, where it indicates movement in addition to location.
Examples:
- a lo largo de - along
- alrededor de - around
- hacia - toward
- mas alla de - beyond
- por - through, throughout
|

What are the prepositions of origin and destination ? |
Prepositions are used to express origin and destination. In actuality, these prepositions are variations of prepositions that show movement. Think of these prepositions as revealing motion in time. Mentally, to reach the origin of something, you move toward the past; to reach a destination, you move toward the future. Below are several frequently used prepositions that indicate origin and destination.
Origin
- a causa de - because of, for
- de - from, of
- de (to indicate authorship) - by
- desde - (all the way) from
- por - because of, for
- por (to indicate authorship) - by

Destination
- a - to
- hacia - toward
- para (purpose or destination) - for
|

What are the prepositions related to adverbs ? How they are formed ? |
With many of the compound prepositions that end in de (encima de, cerca de, lejos de, etc.), especially if the object of the preposition is understood, you can drop the de in the Spanish sentence. These are most often prepositions indicating location. However, the lack of an object for the preposition converts that preposition into an adverb within the sentence. Both the preposition + object and the adverb answer the question where? (La silla esta cerca de la mesa)

Other prepositions indicating location or movement are very closely related to adverbs. The following chart shows six prepositions with related adverbs. The prepositions must be followed by a noun or pronoun as object of the preposition. The adverbs must be placed at the end of a clause or sentence and cannot be followed by a noun.
- adelante de (in front of)
- al lado de (next to)
- atras de (behind)
- debajo de (below, under)
- dentor de (inside)
- fuera de (outside)
- hacia adelante (forward)
- de lado (sideways)
- hacia atras (backward)
- abajo (downstairs, underneath)
- adentro (inside)
- afuera (outside)

What are the differences between para and por ? |
Consider the following pair of sentences (their differences will be explained more clearly later in the chapter):
- Luciano canta para Placido - Luciano canta por Placido
While both sentences translate as “Luciano sings for Plácido,” they have very different meanings. In the first sentence, Luciano is singing to Plácido: Luciano is on the stage, and Plácido is sitting happily in the audience listening to the music. In the second sentence, Luciano is singing on behalf of Plácido: Plácido is nowhere to be found, and Luciano takes his place. In this context, Luciano replaces Plácido.
In a nutshell, think of para as an arrow. In one way or another, para tells where something is going. Por, on the other hand, is like a balance scale, equalizing what is on both sides of the preposition.

What are the uses and meaning of Para ? |
The uses of para can be neatly placed into the following four categories: destination, purpose, deadline, and standard. In all four of these categories, which are discussed in detail below, para indicates distinguishing qualities of nouns in a sentence, often with movement toward a specific goal or destination
|

What is the use of Para for destination ? |
Para indicates the destination of someone or something, whether that destination is real or figurative. Para tells where something is going, could go, or perhaps should go. In this context, para nearly always translates as English “for.”

1. To indicate real or figurative destination
(este jabon es para el bano - this soap is for the bathroom, in the sense of belongs in).
(este telefono es para esa oficina - this telephon is for that office, in the sense of goes into).
(mi casa es buena para la fiesta - my house is good for the party)
(Romeo es perfecto para julieta - romeo is perfect for juliet).

2. To express the recipient of an action
Para tells not only where, but also to whom something is going. The recipient always follows para, which translates as English “for” in this context. (tengo el dinero para juan - i have the money for john, estos regalos son para mi - these gifts are for me).

3. To indicate direction and/or final destination
Para concerns itself only with the final destination, not with any temporary stops along the way. (Contrast this with the use of por to indicate an intermediate destination.) In this context, para can translate as either English “to” or “for.” (los astronautas van para la luna - the astronauts go to the moon, salimos apra la iglesia a las nueve - we leave for church at nine o'clock)

4. To indicate an action’s aim or objective, including profession
Para is used to indicate the final destination or objective of your studies—or what you want to be. For example, in universities in the United States, students often talk about their major. In Spanish, a student majoring in biology could say, Estudio para médico, which translates as “I’m studying to be a physician,” or simply, “I’m studying medicine.” The verb “to be” in this context is understood and therefore can be omitted. You can, if you want, include ser (“to be”), as in the sentence Estudio para ser médico. Note that with this usage, the profession usually remains singular in Spanish, even when the subject is plural, as in the second example below.
(Ella estudia para electricista - she is studying to be an electrician, ellos estudian para carpintero - they are studying to be carpenters).
|

Ho do you express purpose using para ? |
- To express purpose before an infinitive
Something’s purpose is the reason that it exists. In describing what something does, or what it is for, use para + verb. Because a verb is never conjugated after a preposition, the format will always be para + infinitive. This use of para translates as English “for.” (una pluma es para escribir, estos apatos son para corret).

- To indicate purpose for doing something; “in order to” before an infinitive
To give the reason for doing something, use para + infinitive. In this case, para translates as English “to” or “in order to.” (yo como para vivir, estudiamos para aprender).
|

how do you express deadline using para ? |
- To express a specific time limit or deadline in the future
Use para to specify a time limit or deadline in the future, for example, to state by when you need a certain action to have been completed. In this context, para usually translates as English “by”; however, it can also mean “for,” “on,” or “before.”
(tenemos que hacer esto para esta noche, necesita el vestido para el fin de semana, necesitamos el informe para el sabado, necesito la ropa para el jueves).

- To express a limited time span in the future
Use para to express an action that stretches out over a specific period of time in the future. Typically, this is a generalized period of time, as opposed to a period that begins at a specific hour and then ends at a specific hour in the future. This use of para translates as English “for.” (el tiene empleo para el verano, tenemos una casa reservada para dos semanas).
|

how do you express a certain standard using para ? |
- To express a comparison to a certain standard
When comparing someone or something that goes beyond what is expected to what would typically be expected, use para to express that comparison. Para in these cases translates as English “for.”
(paco es alto para su edad, hace calor para enero)

- To express an opinion or personal standard
In order to say, “in my opinion,” you can say, literally, en mi opinión, or you can say more simply, para mí. This construction is used with both names and pronouns. In this context, para translates as English “for.”
(oara mi, el espanol es hermos, para paco, portland es la mejor ciudad).
|
what is the meaning of "por" in spanish ? |
Like a balance scale, por is a great equalizer. The use of por indicates a sense of equality about whatever is on either side of por in a sentence. We trade one thing for another because items are perceived as equal in value. We say how long something lasts, equating the action of “lasting” with an amount of time. We substitute one person or thing for another, because we consider the two persons or items to be of equal value, at least temporarily.
The uses of por can be neatly placed into the following six categories: duration, substitution, motivation, movement, emotions, and idioms. In all six of these categories, which are discussed in detail below, por serves to equate or combine nouns in a sentence, rather than distinguish the differences between them
|

how do you express duration using por ? |
- To express duration of time
When expressing duration, that is, telling how long something lasts, use por. In this context, por translates as English “for.” (cada dia trabajamos por ocho horas, ellos van de vacaciones por dos semanas)

- To indicate periods of time during the 24-hour day
Por used before la mañana, la tarde, la noche, or el día indicates an unspecified amount of time, yet it implies that whatever is taking place lasts a while (as opposed to an extremely short time). In this context, por translates as English “for,” “at,” “during,” “on,” or “throughout.” va a chicago por el dia - he's going to chicago for the day,
tenemos clase por la noche - we have class at night,
ellas va a estudiar por la tarde - she's going to study during the afternoon,
ellos van al templo los viernes por la noche - they go to synagogue on friday nights,
voy al dentista el lunes por la tarde - i'm going to the dentist on monday afternoon,
el toma cafe' por el dia - he drinks coffee throughout the day
|

how do you express substitution or exchange using por ? |
- To indicate an equal exchange or trade
Por implies an equality of the two nouns that it separates. We freely trade or purchase something, because we perceive that what we are giving is equal in value to what we are getting in return. In this context, por usually translates as English “for.” (pague' cinco dolares por la pizza, juan cambio' su manzana por una naranja)

- To express substitution (“on behalf of,” “in place of”)
Por indicates equality in a situation where someone or something is substituted for someone or something else. This is seen in the classroom, in the workplace, and in recipes—whenever the original person or ingredient is not available. In these cases, por usually translates as English “for,” “on behalf of,” or “in place of.” (sustituyo margarina por mantequilla, el vicepresidente habla por el presidente, roberto trabaja po miguel)

- To express thanks and gratitude
To thank someone for something that he or she has done for you, or to express gratitude for a gift, use por. This is another example of por as an equalizer. This is why we say that we give thanks for a kind deed: The thanks balance the act of giving. In this context, por usually translates as English “for.” (gracias por las flores, te doy las gracias por tu ayuda)

|

how do express motivation using por ? |
- To indicate “because of” or having done something (por + infinitive)
To express the reason for having done something, use por + infinitive. This generally translates as “because of” or “due to.” The verb that follows por must be in the infinitive. Expressed in English, this verb is a gerund (which functions as a noun in the sentence), and it always ends in “-ing.” (por ganar la loteria ellos son ricos - due to winning the lottery they are rich; el no trabaja hoy po estar enfermo - he's not working today because of his being sick)

- To express a motive for doing something
Por tells why a person does something by expressing a specific motive. In these cases, por can translate as either English “for” or “because of.” (vamos a la tienda por mantequilla - we're going to the store for butter, reconstruimos la casa por la tormenta - we're rebuilding the hoyse because of the storm).

- To express a reason for something (por + noun or por + infinitive)
Por expresses the reason for something being the way it is; it expresses “why.” In these cases, por is followed by either a noun or an infinitive. The Spanish verb that follows por, when expressed in English, is a gerund (which functions as a noun in the sentence) that always ends in “-ing.” Por can translate as English “for,” “due to,” or “because of.”
- soy mas fuerte por tener la eperiencia (i am stronger for having the experience)
- beethoven es famoso por compones su musica (bethoven is famous for composing his music)
- paco es popular por ser tan inteligente (paco is popular for being so intelliget)
- ella ahorra mucho dinero por los copunes (she saves a lot of money due to coupons)
- ella ahorra mucho dinero por usar cupones (she saves a lot of money due to using coupons)
- paco es popular por su personalidad (paco is popular because of his personality)
- soy mas fuete por la experiencia (i am stronger because of the experience)

how do you express movement using por ? |
- To express means of transportation
To express how someone gets somewhere, use por before the mode of transportation. Several common forms of transportation are listed here. This use of por translates as English “by” or “on.”(viajan de londres  aparis por tren, martin va al trabajo por autobus)

NOTE The preposition en is also used in this way: en avión, en tren, etc.

- To express means of sending messages or information
To talk about sending a message, use the preposition por. Several common ways of sending messages or information are listed here. In this context, por can translate as English “by,” “on,” or “via.” (por computadora, por email, por fax, etc.) (le envio un regalo por correo, no es bueno discutir por telefono, me response por email).

- To indicate the point of an intermediate destination
To indicate an intermediate destination or a temporary stop, use por—for example, a stop by someone’s house or a layover that’s part of a longer trip. Any temporary stop that is not your final destination is indicated by using por. (Contrast this with the use of para to indicate final destination.) In this context, por translates as English “by” or “through.” (voy por el banco antes de ir al teatro, pasamos por detroit en el viaje a paris)

- To indicate movement in an area
While para indicates movement to or toward a destination, por indicates that the person is already there and is moving around in a general, nonspecific direction. In such cases, por can translate as English “around,” “through,” “throughout,” or “by.” (nos paseamos por la ciudad, el detective busca por la casa, marta anda por la tienda)
|

how do you express emotions using por ? |
To express having or feeling something that is intangible—such as respect—for someone, use por. This contrasts with using para to express destination for something tangible, such as a book.
Think of it like this: When you give something tangible away, you are left with nothing; your hand is empty. But you cannot give away emotions, because no matter how much love you give to someone, you will still be filled with love. Something that’s intangible just gets moved around. In this context, por nearly always translates as English “for.” (juan tiene mucho amor por su esposa, tengo respeto por mis amigos).
|

what are the idiomatic expressions using por ? |
por alli around there, that way
por aqui around here, this way
por ejemplo for example
por eso therefore
por esto therefore 
por favor as a favor, please
por fin at last, finally
por (lo) general as a rule, generally
por lo menos at least
por medio de by means of
