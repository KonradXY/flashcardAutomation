How differs the use of the pronouns in spanish from english ? |
The use of subject pronouns in Spanish—when and how they are used—differs from English usage, even when the referent is clearly the same.
It is often not necessary to state or write the subject pronoun in Spanish, because the conjugated form of the verb indicates the subject (for example, the verb ending -o signifies the subject pronoun yo). In English, however, we must include the subject pronoun with the verb. In Spanish, it is only necessary to include the subject pronoun for one of the following reasons.
a. Clarity. In the third person, including the subject pronoun allows you to differentiate between él and ella or ellos and ustedes, for example.
b. Emphasis. To emphasize the difference between two subjects, even though they are both understood, include the subject pronoun.

What is the use and translation of the "who" word in spanish ? |
When your question is about people, and the answer you seek involves a name or names, you ask “Who?”, as in “Who has the cat? John has the cat.” (“John” is the subject of the answer.) In these cases, in Spanish, use ¿Quién? (or ¿Quiénes? when you are seeking the names of two or more people).
|

What is the use and translation of the word "whom" in spanish ? |
To ask the name of a person who is the recipient of an action (as the direct object of the verb), use “Whom?”, as in the sentence “Whom do you love?” The personal a must be included before the interrogative pronoun ¿quién? (or ¿quiénes? if you suspect that the answer involves more than one name).

Example: A quièn ves? Veo a Pedro

Note that the structure for use of the interrogative pronoun is parallel to that of the answer, where the a in the sentence Veo a Pedro Morales is the personal a.
To ask the name of a person who is the indirect recipient of an action (expressed as the object of a preposition), use the preposition a (“to”), as in the sentence “To whom are you writing?” The preposition a (“to”) must be included before the interrogative pronoun ¿quién? (or ¿quiénes?).

Example: A quiènes escribes ? Escribo a Pedro y a Manolo

The structure for use of the interrogative pronoun is parallel to that of the answer here as well, because the a in the sentence Escribo a Pedro y a Manolo represents the English preposition “to.”
NOTE The personal a is not used with the verbs ser, estar, and tener
|

How is translated and what is the use of the word "whose" in spanish ? |
In English, to identify the owner of something, you ask “Whose?” In Spanish, use the phrase ¿De quién? (or ¿De quiénes? if you think that the answer involves more than one name). In simple questions, the phrase—usually followed by a form of ser— is uncomplicated.
Example: De quièn es este libro? De quienès son esos boletos (tickets) ?

However, the use of the phrase does not translate directly in more complicated questions, and it is necessary to rephrase the question. For example, “Whose grandmother lives here?” becomes ¿De quién es la abuela que vive aquí? (literally, “Of whom is the grandmother that lives here?”).

Examples:
- De quièn son los vecinos que no hablan inglés ?
- De quién era el làpiz que pediste prestado ?
- De quiénes son los sombreros que estàn en la mesa?
- De quiénes son los videos màs populares ahora ?
|

What is the translation and use of the word "which" in spanish ? |
To limit a group of items or to ask someone to choose from among a number of items, you use “Which?” or “What?” in your question. In English, “Which?” generally precedes a noun (“Which cookbook do you want?”), while the limiting “What?” usually precedes a verb (“What is the best cookbook for breads?”).
In Spanish, the opposite is usually true. If the interrogative pronoun is followed by a noun, use ¿Qué? If the interrogative pronoun is followed by a verb or a prepositional phrase, use ¿Cuál? or ¿Cuáles? In the context of ¿Cuál? + verb, ¿Cuál? usually means “Which one?”

Examples:
- Qué vestido prefieres? Prefiero el vestido largo
- Cuàl prefieres? Prefiero el vestido largo
- Cuàl de los vestidos prefieres? Prefiero el vestido rojo
- Cuàles prefieres? Prefiero los zapatos negros
- Cuàl de las pinturas es de Mirò ?
- Qué pintura es de Mirò ?
- Qué nùmero de teléfono es correcto ?
|

Whether you use Qué vs Cuàl ? |
Whether to use ¿Qué? or ¿Cuál? in Spanish questions confounds many speakers of English. In a nutshell, questions beginning with ¿Qué? ask for a definition, whereas questions that begin with ¿Cuál? ask the respondent to limit his or her answer to one of many possibilities. Consider the following questions and their literal implications as displayed in the answers:
Qué es tu nombre? Mi nombre es la palabra que la gent usa cuando me llama
Cuàl es tu nombre? Mi nombre es Penèlope
uàl s tu numero de telefono ? Mi numero es ...

As you can see Que? requests a literal answer and Cuàl asks for a selection from a large pool of possible answers. To determine whether to use ¿Qué? or ¿Cuál?, consider the following:
Generally speaking, ¿Qué? precedes a noun and ¿Cuál? precedes a verb.
If you want a definition, use ¿Qué?
If there are many possible answers and you want to know the correct answer in a particular situation—that is, the limited answer—use ¿Cuál?

What are the standard prepositional pronouns in spanish and what are their function ? |
FUNCTION
To replace a noun that names a person or thing following a preposition, serving as the object of that preposition
SPANISH PLACEMENT
Immediately after a preposition
ENGLISH EQUIVALENTS
“me,” “you,” “him,” “her,” “it,” “us,” “them”
NOTE that after a preposition the word ello means "it" when the referent is an object, event or idea that is either msculine or neuter, use ella for a feminine referent.

Example:
- El accidente sucediò hace un ano. El escribiò un cuento acerca de ello.
- Compramos una cama nueva y tenemos las almohadas (pillows) perfectas para ella.
|

What are the pronouns with "con" in spanish ? |
conmigo (with me), contigo (with you), consigo (with him, with them, with you - usted). However in certain situations the standard prepositional pronouns are also used with con in the third person (con el, con ella, con usted, etc.).

In the first and second person singual mi and ti become conmigo and contigo (Por que no vienes conmigo al concierto? Esta bien Iré contigo).

In the third person (both singular and plural) consigo is typically used when the object of the preposition efers to the subject. (El llevò los libros consigo. Ellos llevaron los libro consigo).

Use con plus the appropriate standard prepositional pronoun when the object of the preposition refers to someone other than the subject of the sentence (Mi hermano vive en San Diego y mi padre vive con él. Mi hermano vive con ellos).

In the nosotros and vosotros forms, the subject pronoun and the prepositional pronoun are identical.
|

What are the preposition that takes a subject pronoun ? |
There are six prepositions that take a subject pronoun—even in the first-and second-person singular—instead of the standard prepositional pronouns.
- entre (between)
- excepto (except)
- incluso (including)
- menos (except)
- salvo (except)
- segùn (according to)

The preposition exceptio, menos and salvo all of which means "except" can, for the most pat, be used interchangeably.

Examples:
- Juan està entre tù y yo.
- Todos bailan excepto él
- Todos bailan menos él
- Todos bailan salvo él
- Seguùn él, debemos llegar pronto
- Todos vamos a la fiesta, incluso tù
|

How do you build a reflexive pronoun in spanish ? |
When you do something for yourself, it is called a reflexive action, because the action is reflected back to the performer of the action. A reflexive action can be expressed either with a reflexive pronoun alone or with a preposition + pronoun. When a preposition is used—in the examples given below, we use the preposition a (“to”)—then the pronouns that follow the preposition are as shown below:
a mi mism@, a ti mism@, a si mism@, a nosotros mism@s, a vosotros mism@s, a si mism@s.
|

What are and what is the function of the possessive pronouns in spanish ?|
FUNCTION
To replace the nouns that name the owner of an object and the object itself
SPANISH PLACEMENT
Immediately after a conjugated verb (often ser)
ENGLISH EQUIVALENTS
“mine,” “yours,” “his,” “hers,” “its,” “ours,” “theirs”
Possessive pronouns are not used as frequently in Spanish as they are in English. Because these pronouns stand for the object owned as well as the owner, they agree with the object owned in number and gender.

Spanish possessive pronouns:
- mi@ mi@s,
- tuy@ tuy@s,
- suy@ suy@s,
- nuestr@ nuestr@s,
- vuestr@ vuestr@s,
- suy@ suy@s

The possessive pronoun differs from the possessive adjective in significant ways. The adjective modifies and precedes the noun, as in the sentence Es mi gato (“It is my cat”), whereas the pronoun includes the significance of the noun and follows the conjugated verb, as in the sentence Es mío (“It is mine”). If the noun is plural, the possessive adjective is plural as well: mi gato, mis gatos; tu televisor, tus televisores. The following chart shows the possessive adjectives.

- mi, mis (my)
- tu tus (your)
- su sus (his, her, your, its)
- nuestr@, nuestr@s (our)
- vuestr@ vuestr@s (your)
- su, sus (their, your)

The possessive pronoun frequntly appears after the third-person conjucated forms of ser: es and son (El chaleco (vest)?  Es mìo?, Las hierramientas? Son suyas)
|
What are the possessive pronouns expressing "of mine/yours/etc" in spanish ? |
When the possessive pronoun follows a noun in English, the word “of” is used before the possessive pronoun (“of mine,” “of yours,” “of his,” “of hers,” “of ours,” “of theirs”). In Spanish, there is no need to add de (“of”). Use of the possessive pronoun immediately after a noun adds emphasis to the owner of the object. (Use of the possessive adjective usually emphasizes the object owned.) (La amiga suya es bonita, el coche suyo es un clàsico, esos companeros mios son muy listos (clever))
|

What is the use of possessive pronouns ins tatements of comparison ? |
In Spanish, when two or more things are compared (or contrasted), the name of the first item is mentioned, and the other items are typically referred to by pronouns. This is frequently seen in cases involving possession, as in the sentence “My house is red, but yours (your house) is white.” In these situations, you must use the appropriate definite article with the possessive pronoun.

Examples:
- su casa es roja, pero la suya es blanca
- mi automovil es frances pero el suyo es italiano
- sus marcos (frames) son de plata (silver) pero los mios son de oro
- nuestra marca (brand) es barata, la suya es cara.
|

What is the use of possessive pronouns with regular comparisons ? |
Regular comparisons in Spanish use más… que (“more . . . than”), menos… que (“less . . . than”), or tan… como (“as . . . as”) (Julia es mas alta que Diego, Diego es tan guapo como Antonio Banderas).
When we compare two equally named people or things that are possessed or owned, the first one is mentioned and the second one is usually replaced by a possessive pronoun and the appropriate definite article.
Examples:
- mi amigo es mas alto que el tuyo
- mi amiga es mas interesante que la vuestra
- su casa es menos elegante que la nuestra
- su gato no es tan peludo (furry) como el mio
- mi cafe no esta san sabroso (delicious) como el tuyo
|

What are the possessive pronouns with irregular comparatives ? |
There are four irregular adjective of comparison:
- mejor, mejores (better)
- peor, peores (worse)
- mayor, mayores (older)
- menor, menores (younger)

The Spanish syntax for sentences with these irregular comparatives is identical to English syntax. Note that while these irregular comparatives do not take gender, they do agree in number with the subject of the sentence.

Examples:
- mi tortuga es mejor que la tuya.
- su gorila es mayor que el tuyo
- sus osos (bears) son peores que los nuestros
- mis moscas son menores que las tuyas
|
What are the demonstrative pronouns in spanish and what is their function ? |
FUNCTION
To replace an understood noun and point out its location relative to the speaker
SPANISH PLACEMENT
Before the verb (when used as a subject) or immediately after the verb (when used as an object)
ENGLISH EQUIVALENTS
“this (one),” “that (one),” “these (ones),” “those (ones)”
The pronouns in the following chart may look familiar to you, because they are identical to demonstrative adjectives, except that the demonstrative pronouns take an accent mark. Think of it like this: If you drop the noun, the demonstrative adjective picks up an accent mark and becomes a demonstrative pronoun.
The exception to this rule is the neuter forms: esto, eso, and aquello. These forms are discussed later.

this - este, esta, esto (m, f, neuter)
these - estos, estas
that - ese esa eso
those - esos esas
that over there - aquel, aquella aquello
those over there - aquellos aquellas

When the pronoun refers to and includes the significance of something in particular, the gender and number of that referent are reflected in the pronoun.
Examples
- Este coche es mio pero ese es suyo
la mejor marca es esta
- estas ventanas estan limpias, pero esas todavia faltan por limpiar (need to be cleaned)
- Aquellas mesas son de roble (oak), esas son de pino (pine) y estas son de caoba (mahogany).
|
What are the neuter demonstrative pronouns and when they are used ? |
In Spanish, to refer to something nonspecific (“That’s not true!”) or when you don’t know or can’t express the name of the referent (“What is this?”), use the neuter demonstrative pronoun. In other words, if there is no direct referent (so that it cannot be stated), the neuter demonstrative pronoun must be used.
The neuter demonstrative pronouns follows: esto (this), eso (that) aquello (those).

Demonstrative pronouns are generally used in exclamation, questions, and abstractions:
- esto es absturdo
- que es eso ?
- aquello es una monstruosidad
- no tengo dinero, por eso no puedo ir
|

How are used numbers as pronouns in spanish ? |
FUNCTION
To replace an understood or omitted noun, assuming the meaning of the noun itself as well as the number
SPANISH PLACEMENT
Before the verb (when used as a subject) or after the verb (when used as an object)
- un@ - primer@
- dos - segund@
- tres - tercer@
- cuatro - cuart@
- cinco - quint@
- seis - sext@
- siete - septim@
- ocho - octav@
- nueve - noven@
- diez - decim@

The cardinal numbers continue into infinity. However, after décimo (“tenth”), the ordinal forms offer two possibilities: Continue in the pattern with or dinal numbers— onceavo (“eleventh”), doceavo (“twelft h”), treceavo (“thirteenth”), etc.—or, more commonly, use the cardinal number either alone or placed after the noun.

When used as pronouns, cardinal numbers include the significance of the understood noun, for example, “How many children do you have? I have three.” In this case, “three” represents “three children.” Remember that when you use the number uno (“one”) as a pronoun, it changes to una when replacing a feminine noun (Cuantos libros lees tu al ano? Leo uno; Estas galletas son para la fiesta? Pues, solo comì una)
|

How are used ordinal numbers as pronouns in spanish ? |
When an ordinal number serves as an adjective, it precedes the noun and agrees with it in number and gender. The noun in these cases is always in its singular form: el segundo libro, la segunda iglesia.
If the noun is omitted, the ordinal number serves instead as a pronoun. The meaning of the noun is then understood, its gender is shown by the -o or -a ending, and the article is retained: el segundo libro becomes el segundo.

- Tienes el primer libro y el tercer libro, y yo tengo el segundo
- Febrero es el segundo mes y enero es el primero
- ella vive en la cuarta casa y el vive en la quinta

Note that as adjectives, the ordinals primero and tercero drop the -o when preceding a masculine singular noun: primer libro, tercer libro. As a pronoun, the -o ending is retained: el primero.
|

What are some examples and uses of qualitative adjective pronouns in spanish ? |
In Spanish, this efficiency is seen when descriptive, or qualitative, adjectives become pronouns. In English, we generally add the word “one,” as in the sentence “He has the green apple, and I have the red one.” In Spanish, the adjective assumes the entire meaning of the noun: Él tiene la manzana verde y yo tengo la roja. The adjective retains the gender and number of the omitted noun, as well as the appropriate definite article (el, la, los, or las). In the sentence, it also represents the full meaning of the noun.

- El lee el libro grande, y yo leo el pequeno
- a mi me gusta la mesa azul, pero a ti te gusta la roja
- tu llevas zapatos negros y to llevo los blancos
- nosotros pintamos las casas enormes y ellos pintan las muy pequenas
|

What are and what is the use of quantitative adjectives pronouns in spanish ? |
Adjectives that are quantitative tell us the number or amount of the noun to which they refer. When a number is placed before a noun (for example, “two cats”), that number functions as an adjective. When the noun is understood and dropped, the adjective takes on the status of a pronoun, because it includes the meaning of the noun. (yo tengo tres cajas y el tiene cuatro; hay dos mesas alli pero solo una aqui).

Many quantitative adjectives are not actual numbers themselves. Instead, they refer to an amount, with an indirect way of revealing number. Most of these words can function as adjectives: algunos platos (“some plates”), todos los invitados (“all the guests”). When they stand alone or are used to refer to a noun or other antecedent, they function as pronouns: algunos (“some of them”), todos (“all of them”). Below are several commonly used quantitative adjectives.

Vocabolario:
- algunos algunas (some, any of them)
- ambos ambas (both)
- casa uno, cada una (each one)
- demasiad@ (too much)
- demasiad@s (too many)
- la mayoria (the majority)
- l@s demàs  (the rest)
- l@s dos (both, the two)
- mas (more)
- menos (less)
- much@ (a lot (of something))
- much@ (a lot (of things), many things)
- nada (nothing)
- ningun@ (none, neither one, not anything, not a single one)
- otr@ (another, the other (one))
- poc@ (a little)
- primer@ (first)
- tod@ (everything, all)
- ultim@ (last)
- un@s (some)
 - un@s cuant@s (a few (of them))
 - vari@s  (several)

 - Examples:
- a el le gusta el vestido rojo mas que el verde pero a mi me gustan ambos.
- jorge come todas las galletas en el paquete, pero felipe come solo unas cuantas.
- cada ano intento ahorrar dinero, pero acabo por gastar demasiado
- todos los miembros querian participar en el comitè (committee) pero ninguno queria trabajar duro.
|

What are the adjective pronouns that refer to unspecified people in spanish ? |
When a pronoun replaces a known person, a subject pronoun is often used. Instead of “John,” we use “he”; for “John and Carlos,” we use “they,” and so on.
Frequently, however, we speak of people whose names we do not know, cannot know, or whose identity, considering the situation, is irrelevant. In these cases, use an appropriate pronoun. Below are several common adjective pronouns that refer to unspecified people
- alguien (someone, somebody)
- cualesquiera (any)
- cualquiera (anyone, anybody, any one (person))
- el mayor (the oldest)
- el menor (the youngest)
- el que (the one who, he who)
- los que (they who, those who, the ones who)
- nadie (no one, nobody)
- ninguno (neither one)
- todos (everyone)

Examples:
- el mayor recive todos los privilegios
- santa claus tiene regalos para Todos- el que cree esto està loco
- nadie va de compras aqui
- cualquiera de mis amigos puede hablar espanol
- cualesquiera de ustedes harian lo mismo
|

What are the adjective pronouns that refer to unspecified things in spanish ? |
With things, as with people, when the name of the referent is either unknown or irrelevant, you need a nonspecific, gender-neutral pronoun.
Below are several common adjective pronouns that refer to unspecified things.
- algo (something, anything)
- cualesquiera (any)
- cualquiera (anything, any one, whichever, whatever)
- lo mejor (the best)
- lo mismo (the same)
- lo peor (the worst)
- nada (nothing)

Examples:
- puedes tener cualquiera d estas galletas
- cuando vamos de vacaciones, siempre hacemos lo mismo
- lo mejor en la vida es gratis
