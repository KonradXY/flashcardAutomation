Pedro is my friend. I am very happy, because he lives next door to me. A raccoon lives underneath my house. Between you [pl.] and me, I think that raccoons are interesting animals. I’m reading a book about them now. Usually the raccoon lives in a tree, but I am lucky because my house is on top of this raccoon. According to Pedro, the raccoon is part of the bear family, and he believes that if he sees the animal in front of him, it’s “good-bye, world.” When Pedro leaves (from) or enters (into) my house, he always looks to the left and then to the right.

I am very upset because Silvia has my ring. She says that it is hers, but I know that it is mine, because it has my initials. Silvia is a kleptomaniac. Nothing in her house is hers. Many things are mine. For example, all the paintings are mine, the grandfather clock is mine, the candelabra in the dining room is mine, the washer and dryer are mine, even the food in the refrigerator is mine. What can I do? The famous lawyer Perry Mason (of classic television) says that possession is ninety-nine percent of the law. Therefore, everything is hers.

“Who needs this? This is so stupid! I don’t need this for my job.” Some people say this when they are frustrated or when they have to take a class at (en) the university that they don’t want to take. It’s this class or that one. It’s this professor or that one. It’s these books or those. It’s these assignments or those. When does this end? Does this end after graduation? Unfortunately, no. This is often an attitude for life.

Whenever we eat together, my friend and I compete (in order) to see who can eat more. For example, when we eat crackers, if I eat one, he eats two. Then I eat three, and he eats four. The first contestant with an empty plate is the winner. This is easy with crackers or grapes or cherries. But it is very difficult with hamburgers. The first is delicious. The second is, too. The third is not bad. The fourth is a challenge. The fifth is absurd—also the sixth, the seventh, and the eighth. The ninth is pure torture. And the tenth is impossible. It’s worse with pies!

This sign says, “Today is the first day of the rest of your life.” If this is true, then what is tomorrow? The second? I can’t believe everything that I read. No one can. Some (people) believe everything. Some people believe the ads in the backs of magazines. I suppose that some of these are true, but the majority of these ads are lies. Who are these hucksters? They promise everything and deliver nothing.
