What is the present subjunctive e how is formed ? |
The subjunctive mood can be defined in terms of the situations in which it is used,
often described as fitting into these eight categories.
1 Desire (I hope that you are happy, I suggest that you buy the red car ..)
2 Ignorance (I doubt that he lives here, I don't think that she knows my name)
3 Emotional statement or comment (I'm happy that you're the president)
4 Impersonal opinion (It's great that you can dance so well, It's terrible that we have to wait)
5 Uncompleted action (We'll eat after we wash our hands, I'll feel better when I sit down)
6 Vague or indefinite antecedent (I need an assistant who is punctual, He wants a wife who cooks as well as his mother)
7 “Perhaps” and “maybe” (Perhaps she'll call us tonight, maybe he has the money).
8 “Even if ” (Even if he knows, he won't tell us)

The formation of the present subjunctive works as this: there are 3 steps involved:
1) Begin with the yo form of the present indicative (hablo, como, vivo, conozco, tengo)
2) remove the -o
3) add the following endings:
  -ar verbs (-e -es -e -emos -èis -en)
  -er verbs (-a -as -a -amos -àis -an)
  -ir verbs (-a -as -a -amos -àis -an)

Below are the full conjugation in the present subjunctive for some verbs:
hablar -> hable hables hable hablemos hablèis hablen
comer -> coma comas coma comamos comàis coman
vivir -> viva vivas viva vivamos vivàis vivan

NB: Note that there is no stem change in the nosotros or vosotros forms of any of the verbs above. In stem-changing -ir verbs however the present subjunctive shows the following chages in the stem of the nosotros and vosotros forms:
- o > ue verbs -> the o changes to u -> dormir (durmamos, durmàis)
- e > ie verbs -> the e changes to i -> mentir (mintamos, mantàis)
- e > i verbs -> the e chages to i -> pedir (pidamos, pidàis)
