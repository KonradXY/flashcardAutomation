When it is used and which form has the present perfect ? |
The present perfect is a compound tense, which means that it requires an auxiliary: haber.
We often use the present perfect tense when speaking about something that was true in the past and is still true.
The present perfect is also used to indicate than an action was completed recently.
An important aspect of the present perfect tense is that the action referred to takes place in a span of time, either stated or implied, that leads up to and includes the present. However, the action referred to within this span of time took place at a time that is not precisely specified or implied (as in the preterite).
The formation of the present perfect is this one:
- auxiliary haber -> he, has, ha, hemos, habèis, han + Past Participle.

Regular past participles are:
-ar verbs -> Drop the -ar ending and replace it with -ado (hablar -> hablado)
-er verbs -> Drop the -er ending and replace it with -ido (comer -> comido)
-ir verbs -> Drop the -ir ending and replace it with -ido (vivir -> vivido)

There are two guidelines that will help you in your use of the present perfect tense.
1) The conjugated form of haber in the past participle are not - and cannot be - separated by any other words.
2) Obejct pronouns always precede the conjugated form of the verb haber.

Which are the irregular patterns for the present perfect ? |
One group of irregular past participles follows a pattern. Most -er and -ir verbs with a vowel (othen than u) immediately preceding the infinitive ending have past participles that end with -ìdo (atraer - atraìdo).
Other past participles are just irregular and have to be learned individually.

What is and how is composed the past perfect tense ? |
The past perfect tense is a compound tense which requires the auxiliary haber.
We use the past perfect tense (sometimes called the pluperfect tense) when refetting to an action that occurred prior to soemthing else.
When using this tense there is always a stated or implied cutoff point.
The past perfect differs from the present perfect in that sentences in the present perfect are still true: in the present perfect the cutoff point is now. In the past perfect the cutoff point is at some time in the past.
The formation of the past perfect is:
- auxiliary haber in the form of the imperfect (habìa, habìas, habìa, habìamos, habìais, habìan) + the past participle of the verb.
