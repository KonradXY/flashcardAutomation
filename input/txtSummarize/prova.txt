Learning is a process of experimenting in two ways. First, the act of learning itself is a kind of trial and error. Practicing directly, getting feedback, and trying to summon up the right answers to problems are all ways of adjusting the knowledge and skills you have in your head to the real world. Second, the act of experimenting also lies in the process of trying out your learning methods. Try out different approaches, and use the ones that work best for you. The principles I’ve tried to articulate in this book should provide good starting points. But they are guidelines, not iron rules; starting points, not destinations. Only by experimenting will you be able to find the right trade-offs between different principles—for instance, when directness is more important and when you should focus on drills or whether retention or intuition is the main obstacle to learning. Experimenting will also help you decide among small differences in approach that no list of principles could possibly cover exhaustively.
