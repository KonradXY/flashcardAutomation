<div class="front"> is Asking for reassurance a bad habit ? </div>	<div class="back">  When we feel anxious, ask for reassurance, and then get it, we temporarily feel relieved of our anxiety and fears. Like a fast-acting pain medication, reassurance is great at alleviating emotional pain and doubt in the short term. But just like all pain medication, reassurance is a Band-Aid that treats the symptoms, not the cause. By seeking reassurance, you’re telling your brain that the feeling of anxiety is dangerous and needs to be eliminated. Or else something bad will surely happen. So even though reassurance-seeking often makes you feel a little better now, in the long term, it’s only intensifying your anxiety and low confidence because it’s training your brain to be afraid of being afraid. The solution to this dilemma of reassurance-seeking and continually worse confidence is in a very subtle distinction when it comes to fear: Just because something feels scary doesn’t mean it actually is dangerous. If you want to be more confident, you must train your brain to believe that feeling anxious is uncomfortable but not dangerous. That it’s something you can handle. But your brain’s never going to believe you can handle your fear and insecurities if you’re always running to other people to get reassurance. The next time you feel anxious, validate that feeling as scary and uncomfortable, but remind yourself that simply being afraid isn’t dangerous. Show your brain that you can tolerate feeling afraid without resorting to reassurance-seeking, and it will reward you with confidence in the future. </div>

<div class="front">  is Ruminating on past mistakes a bad habit ? </div>	<div class="back">  Rumination is form of thinking where we repeatedly review and replay previous mistakes or negative events in the past even thought doing so has no real benefit but does have the side-effect feeling bad about yourself. The key to undoing a habit of rumination and useless self-criticism is to realize what you’re getting out of it and how it’s not really worth it. Is the temporary relief of helplessness really worth the long-term blows to your confidence? Is that brief feeling of “I can figure this out!” really worth a night of terrible sleep and sluggishness the next day? Learn to accept helplessness and uncertainty. We make mistakes. And often we can’t do anything about it. Such is life. The best we can do is work to be better going forward. And one of the best ways to be better in the future is to improve our confidence and self-worth. So drop the habit of rumination and give yourself permission to live life going forward instead of keeping yourself a prisoner of the past. </div>

<div class="front">  is Expecting too much of themselves a bad habit ? </div>	<div class="back">  Confident people are anti-perfectionists. Despite the common belief that perfectionism is about being perfect (perfect grades, perfect home, perfect performance), perfectionism is really about feeling perfect. See, perfectionists have a hard time tolerating the emotional impact of imperfection. Deep down, they believe that the only way to be truly lovable or useful or good is if they’re perfect. And when they inevitably fail to live up to the rather high standard of perfect, they feel bad. And in order to feel less bad about being less-than-perfect, they strive all the more to be perfect. Once again, cue the vicious cycle… Perfectionism and the need to feel perfect are a setup for poor confidence and low self-esteem. It means that anytime you feel bad, you’re not doing things correctly and need to work harder. Stop fighting imperfection and confidence will follow. If you want to be more confident, think of standards and expectations as a tool — something you should cultivate and use but not become a slave to. Practice tolerating and welcoming imperfection, uncertainty, and failure. If you stop fighting imperfection and learn to embrace it, confidence will follow. </div>

<div class="front">  is Worrying about things they can’t control a bad habit ? </div>	<div class="back">  Worry is the flip side of rumination. Just like rumination is unhelpful thinking about mistakes or bad things in the past, worry is unhelpful thinking about potential dangers in the future. The key to undoing the habit of worry, lowering your chronic anxiety, and building up your confidence is to become okay with lack of control. If you can practice acknowledging and accepting how little control you actually have in your life, you’ll find your confidence will grow. And on top of that, you’ll have more energy and time to invest in the things you do actually have control over. If you want to be confident, stop worrying about the life you don’t have and take responsibility for the life you do have. </div>

<div class="front">  is Making decisions based on how they feel a bad habit ? </div>	<div class="back">  Confident people use values-based reasoning to make decisions, not emotion-based reasoning. When we consistently act in a way that’s contrary to our own values, we erode our trust in ourselves — and along with it, our self-confidence. Each time you say something’s important, then act contrary to that commitment, you teach your brain that you can’t be trusted and that you’re not reliable. And the biggest reason we all do this is because our feelings tell us something different. See, our feelings and emotions tend to be oriented toward what feels good in the short-term: Avoiding pain, feeling pleasure, eliminating uncertainty, etc… Of course, there’s nothing wrong with any of these per se. The problem is, the pursuit of feeling good now, often comes at the expense of doing good in the future. On the other hand, when we regularly follow-through on what we say is important to us, our brain trusts us more. Which means, the next time we’re faced with something difficult, your brain is likely to respond with confidence (Yeah, we got this!) as opposed to fear (I don’t know… Seems too tough.). In short, if you want to build confidence, you need to change your relationship with your emotions. Try to see them as potentially useful messengers but never primary decision makers. Begin in small ways to consistently follow through on decisions you’ve committed to, each time knowing that you’re building trust in yourself. And when your brain really starts to trust that you’re the kind of person who goes after what’s really important — as opposed to what feels good or easy now — that’s when the confidence comes. </div>

<div class="front">  what could be a good strategy in improving your self esteem ? </div>	<div class="back">  If you struggle with low self-confidence, a new strategy might be to approach it in reverse: Rather than trying to do things that will add confidence or make you feel more confident, work on eliminating things that are killing your confidence. </div>

<div class="front">  what is the only thing you have to do before 8 am? </div>	<div class="back">  You just need to do one thing that ensures you have the energy to walk into the office with a smile on your face. It doesn’t have to be complicated. It could be that getting up just 15 minutes earlier to play with your kids at the park on the way to school does the trick. It could mean that watching stand-up comedy during your commute boosts your mood. Or maybe it’s as simple as going for a walk or as silly as dancing to a cheesy song. Both promotions and opportunities are given to those who other people like working with. This becomes much easier if you acknowledge your co-workers and you look like you actually enjoy coming to work with them from time to time. I’d be willing to bet that if you hid in most offices by lunchtime you could identify who’s on the fast-track and who isn’t simply by observing their mood. Sure there may be the rare unicorn that is so good their attitude can be ignored. But for most mortals, the energy you bring today determines the opportunities you are rewarded with tomorrow. Take note of the days you arrive to work in a good mood. If you look at your actions closely enough you’re bound to see some patterns. Was it because you finally went to the gym before work? Was it because you woke up slow and read or wrote? Was it because you played with your kids or made your partner breakfast? Hell, it may even be as simple as you didn’t look at your phone. Of course, arriving to work happy doesn’t guarantee the rest of the day will run smoothly. Bad things will happen. Stress is inevitable. But if you don’t do what you can to go into work in a good mood, the odds are high that nothing inside your office walls will give you a reason to smile. We all have different titles and responsibilities, but when we cut through the noise we all have the same job: make the days of the people around us a little brighter. This becomes much easier if you suck it up and do whatever you can to not be so miserable before going to work. </div>

<div class="front">  Why You Aggressively Dislike People Who Are Most Like You ? </div>	<div class="back">  The traits that make you irrationally, obsessively angry — especially when they are innocuous— are often disassociated aspects of your own psyche. There are so many things to be enraged about in life. So many truly devastating facts about the world. There are foreign affairs and climate change, prejudices and wealth gaps, trafficking and mass school shootings happening at an unprecedented frequency. If you want to truly be angry at something, there’s a lot to choose from. But how often do these very real and legitimate threats take up your mind space, or elicit an intense emotional reaction in the same way that you allow the behaviors of people closest to you affect you? If you’re like most people, it’s not even a comparison, and there’s a reason for this. You most aggressively dislike people who are most like you. When you see someone doing something that you do not realize that you do, it is very often because you are suppressing your awareness of the behavior. When other people act on our own unconscious impulses, we recognize them. We identify the motive immediately. Our instinct is to in some way shut down their course of action in the same way that we have shut down our own. You assume other people are following your own logic, prioritizing their own interests over other people’s wellbeing. Except you don’t know that. The frustration you feel is simply a reflection of your own maligned behaviors and intents. You don’t know that the person walking slowly is physically incapable of moving faster, or that the person in a trying relationship won’t end up with their partner eventually, or that your acquaintance’s new career path is really right for them. All you know is what was right for you, and you’re projecting it onto situations around you that seem similar. Within this is a great opportunity for growth. Instead of raging at other people for not being perfect, we can correct ourselves instead. Now that you’re a little more self-aware, maybe next time you’ll move to the side of the grocery aisle so others can pass. Now that you know the temporary pain of rejection and loss is nothing compared to sustaining delusional hope, maybe you can be the friend to calmly and kindly wait while others find that out, too. Maybe in the same way that it took you some time to figure out your career path, you can have compassion for others on their path of self-discovery. Maybe you can offer up a compliment to someone looking for validation, because you know what it’s like to need it. The point isn’t that we’re so much like the people who frustrate us, it should take a hit to our self-esteem. It should, instead, bolster our self-awareness, and encourage us to look more clearly on how we interact with the world, given how we prefer the world interacts with us. </div>

<div class="front">  5 Ways to Battle Negative Thinking — and Win </div>	<div class="back">  Allow- Allow your thoughts and feelings to come and go like the weather. This helps you accept that negative thoughts are a temporary response to a situation, not a sign that you’re a bad or incapable person. Watch - Pay attention to the stories you’re telling yourself, such as, “this always happens,” “I never do anything right,” or “I should have done….” You can choose a helpless narrative or an empowering one. Pick wisely by asking yourself, “What is within my control?” Acknowledge - Name the emotions that arise for you. Instead of, “I feel bad,” go deeper. Do you feel worried? Resentful? Scared? Research shows that labelling feelings are a powerful way to cope with stress and develop better emotional intelligence. Release - As mindfulness experts Dr. Bob Stahl and Steve Flowers say: “You don’t have to believe everything you think. Why stay in a prison of self when the door is wide open? Let everything go. Let everything be.” Expect - The final step in the AWARE framework is to practice self-compassion. Expect realistic improvement. Be patient with yourself. Changing your mindset isn’t an overnight process. Negative thoughts will still appear from time to time. That’s OK! Think of them as an opportunity to practice your new habit and soon it will be second nature. </div>

<div class="front">  Confident people avoid pressing their own agenda </div>	<div class="back">  The truly confident know they will get what they want out of life in due time. As a result, they don’t run around telling everyone they meet about their grand plans. Instead, they possess an “I can and will learn from everyone” attitude and enjoy nothing more than learning about the perspectives, thoughts, and feelings of the people around them. This is for the simple reason that they like people and they want to do good by them. Next time you’re in a group setting, take note of who guides the conversation and how: Who asks the most thoughtful questions, and who listens more than they speak? Confident people don’t need to control a conversation. They know their own agenda; they want to learn about the goals, dreams, and passions of the people around them. </div>

<div class="front">  Confident people proactively connect others </div>	<div class="back">  Confident people are givers and they are constantly on the look-out to help other people achieve their goals. One way they do this is by sharing their network and connecting like-minded people every chance they get. Not only that, but when it comes to introducing people they take the time do so in a thoughtful way. How do you feel when someone introduces you like, “You’ve got to meet Todd. He was the guy I was telling you about who has a knack for thinking outside the box.” Pretty incredible right? It’s much better than just, “Hey, this is my colleague Todd.” </div>

<div class="front">  Confident people share their ideas freely </div>	<div class="back">  In addition, to sharing their network, confident people do not hog their creative insights. In fact, they freely give them away as often as they can. How can I help Nick solve the problem he is facing? How could Lisa get more eyes on her project? What is Ian missing from moving his business from good to great? Confident people ask themselves these questions because they receive great satisfaction from helping people to reach their goals. Plus, they recognize that life is short, and the best way to see their ideas turn into reality is by giving them to other people. </div>

<div class="front">  Confident people persevere intelligently </div>	<div class="back">  Confident people know what they want, and they have the gumption to keep fighting for it, even when the odds are stacked heavily against them. Then again, plenty of people do that. What separates the truly confident from the overconfident is their ability to seek out advice from people with varying points of view. Not only that, but confident people aren’t afraid to change their minds when they are presented with a better alternative. It’s not a question of who’s right or wrong. If there’s a better idea, confident people adopt it, then thank the person for their advice and pay the favor forward. </div>

<div class="front">  Confident people don’t get hung up on things that are outside their control </div>	<div class="back">  Confident people fight to get things right. But they also recognize that much of what happens in life is outside their control and they have an almost stoic resolve to let things run their course after they’ve done everything in they can. Weigh the options. Seek out advice from people you respect from both sides of the aisle. Make a decision. Let things play out. Like most advice this is easy to say and hard to do — but confident people don’t shy away just because something is difficult. </div>

<div class="front">  Confident people verbal and non-verbal cues line up </div>	<div class="back">  Researchers have found that the congruence between what’s said out loud and what’s communicated without words is crucial for establishing trust. Confident people understand the importance of this and when you’re in their company you’ll not only see that they’re being attentive, you’ll feel it— in the way they position their bodies and make eye contact. They lean in when they sense something means a great deal to you and they’re not afraid to give a subtle touch when warranted to show you that they truly care for you. </div>

<div class="front">  Confident people don’t seek approval from others </div>	<div class="back">  Attention feeds the human appetite on some level for everybody, but the truly confident, as Kareem Abdul Jabbar once put it, just want “to play the game well and go home.” I recently overheard someone say, “Surely you heard about what I did?” The crowd thinned out pretty quickly after that one. Confident people play for the name on the front of the jersey and deflect most attention onto the team — or onto someone who went unnoticed. They know that sharing the spotlight is far more satisfying than going it alone. </div>

<div class="front">  Confident people celebrate the success of others </div>	<div class="back">  If you know what you want and are on a path to achieving it, what’s stopping you from truly being happy for somebody who fought hard to achieve one of their goals? Confident people take real pleasure in seeing other people succeed and recognize the importance of supporting others. They remember how they, too, are empowered by others at key times in their lives. After all, being truly happy for other people has this funny way of adding to your own happiness. </div>
